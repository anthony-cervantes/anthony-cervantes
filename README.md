## **Summary**

Senior Software Engineer & Systems Architect with 18+ years building large-scale automation, distributed systems, and AI/ops tooling. Led Rackspaceâ€™s automation platform from legacy orchestration to a resilient, low-latency event engine processing **2M+ events/week**. Drove multiâ€‘year **cost takeout ($500k+ annual)** and **latency reductions (10Ã—)** through pragmatic redesigns (Cassandra/ScyllaDB, Redis, Linux consolidation). Hands-on across Python, Go, Java/C#, and **Rust** (new stack for highâ€‘throughput services). Calm under pressure; opinionated about reliability, observability, and operability.

## **Experience**

### **Rackspace Technology â€” San Antonio, TX**

**Senior Software Engineer / Systems Architect**

**2021â€“Present**

- Lead engineer for **Rackspace Business Automation (RBA)**â€”mission-critical workflow platform handling **2M+ events/week**, ~**40 actions per event**; improved endâ€‘toâ€‘end latency, stability, and debuggability.
- **Database modernization & performance**: Tuned hot paths, redesigned tables/indexes, and implemented **ScyllaDB** improvements; reduced p95 query latency **~10Ã—** (â‰ˆ100ms â†’ â‰ˆ10ms) and increased DB uptime **95% â†’ 98%+**.
- **Reliability engineering**: Introduced Redis Sentinel replication, hardened SaltStack-based fleet automation, and added proactive anomaly detection hooks for high-signal alerts.
- **Observability**: Standardized metrics/logs to Grafana/Loki; added run-history tracing and deviceâ€‘level drillâ€‘downs; cut mean time to diagnose (MTTD) for noisy workflows.
- **Security & compliance**: Led portions of PCI and adâ€‘hoc audit responses; automated evidence gathering and patch orchestration for Linux/Windows estates.
- **Developer experience**: Authored internal tools to bootstrap servers and repeatable environments; mentored devs on Rust adoption for low-latency services.

**Enterprise Architect (Automation Pillar)**

**2019â€“2021**

- Owned strategy and execution for automation architecture; partnered with Enterprise Architecture group to implement business value modeling and process improvements.
- **Cost takeout**: Migrated NoSQL stack **from DataStax Enterprise to ScyllaDB** â†’ **$385k/yr** saved; consolidated OS from **Windows Server to CentOS** â†’ **$102k/yr** saved.
- Delivered measurable platform outcomes: **latency ~10Ã— better**, **DB uptime +3pp**, improved resiliency and operability across teams.

**Software Developer IV**

**2014â€“2019**

- Led RBA enhancements to scale from hundreds of thousands to **millions** of weekly events; maintained strict SLAs for ticketing and device orchestration.
- Drove crossâ€‘company Moogsoft correlation rollout, cutting nonâ€‘valueâ€‘add alerts **85% â†’ 95%** and freeing operators for higherâ€‘impact work.

**Software Developer III**

**2011â€“2014**

- Replaced BMC Atrium Orchestrator (legacy) â†’ custom solution; **$500k/yr** savings.
- Migrated from MS SQL Server â†’ Apache Cassandra; **$100k/yr** savings; enabled atâ€‘scale write throughput.
- Built secure remote execution for device fleet (kernel/security patches, scripted maintenance) to reduce manual toil.

**Software Developer II**

**2009â€“2011**

- Early automation initiative: ticketing from monitoring events at **~100k events/week**; integrated SOAP/DB systems; managed RealOps release processes.

**Monitoring Administrator I**

**2007â€“2009**

- Monitored global customer infrastructure; mentored admins; coâ€‘designed process improvements that fed into the later automation program.

---

## **Selected Projects**

- **Architect** (Rackspace internal): Portal for automated server builds, hardening, and production cutovers with deep integration to the automation stack.
- **ScyllaDB-based Search API**: REST abstraction for trigram/exactâ€‘match queries with dynamic filters; designed for .NET consumers; Rust service layer with envâ€‘var config and Docker packaging.
- **SentinelEdge**: Prototype **Rust** inference engine (agent-core) + Python model-lab for anomaly detection on infra events; streams ScyllaDB CDC; realâ€‘time alerting.
- **SRE Sentinel** (hackathon): Offline, privacyâ€‘first SRE copilot combining local LLMs, CLI tooling, and a minimal web UI for diagnostics.
- **Arc Reactor Notifier** (personal): Raspberry Pi Pico W + NeoPixel ring; idle pulse & colored alerts mapped to custom event types.
